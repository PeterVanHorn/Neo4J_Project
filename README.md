# Neo4J_Project
This is a basic C# program that creates a bunch of nodes and relationships in a desktop version of Neo4J.
I made this for a final project for a modern databases class. It is basically a demonstration of the order and visual representation of creating a database using NEo4J.
The environment is fairly complicated and I have to create instructions for how to set up Neo4J desktop in order for this project to work.
